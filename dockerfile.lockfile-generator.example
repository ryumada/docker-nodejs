# Dockerfile.lockfile-generator
# This Dockerfile is used ONLY to generate a package-lock.json file.
# It should NOT be used as the primary Dockerfile for your application.

FROM node:${DOCKER_NODEJS_TAG} AS lockfile_generator

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy only package.json and any other relevant package definition files
# (e.g., npm-shrinkwrap.json if you use it, though package-lock.json is more common)
# We specifically do NOT copy package-lock.json here because we want to generate it.
COPY app/${APP_NAME}/package.json ./

# Run npm install to generate (or update) the package-lock.json file.
# We are intentionally using 'npm install' here because 'npm ci' requires an existing lock file.
# This command will read package.json and create/update package-lock.json.
RUN npm install

# This stage doesn't run an application, it just prepares the environment
# for copying out the generated file. You don't need EXPOSE or CMD here.

# You can run this command to generate your package-lock.json file
# docker build -f dockerfile.lockfile-generator -t ${APP_NAME}-lockfile-generator . && \
# docker run --rm \
#   --name temp-lockfile-gen-container \
#   ${APP_NAME}-lockfile-generator \
#   cat /usr/src/app/package-lock.json > app/${APP_NAME}/package-lock.json
